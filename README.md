# Passfort

A secure command-line password manager written in Rust. Passfort lets you store, retrieve, and manage passwords locally with AES-256-GCM encryption. It offers both a traditional CLI interface and an interactive text-based UI, complete with password generation and service search features.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Encrypts passwords using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from a master password via Argon2.
- **CLI and UI Modes**: Use subcommands (`add`, `get`, `list`, `search`) or an interactive menu (`ui`).
- **Password Generation**: Automatically generates strong, random alphanumeric passwords.
- **Search Functionality**: Find stored services by partial name match.
- **Local Storage**: Saves encrypted data in a JSON file (`passwords.json`) with restrictive permissions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable) and Cargo (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
- A Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS) for file permission settings (Windows support is partial).

### Build and Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konpavidis/passfort.git
   cd passfort
   ```
2. Build the release version:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Install the binary
   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```
## Usage 
Passfort is invoked as pf and requires a master password on each run to derive the encryption key.
#### CLI Mode
  1. Add a password
     ```bash
     pf add <service> <username> <password or [--length <number>] >
     ```
     - Example: pf add github myuser mypass (or --lenght 12)
  2. Get a password
     ```bash
     pf get <service>
     ```
  3. List services
     ```bash
     pf list
     ```

## Notes
Enter your master password when prompted. Use the same password across sessions to access your data.
If you forget your master password, data in passwords.json cannot be recoveredâ€”delete the file to start fresh.

### File Structure
- passwords.json: Stores encrypted passwords and a salt (created in the working directory).
- Permissions are set to 600 (owner read/write only) on Unix systems.

### Security
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM with unique nonces per password.
- Key Derivation: Argon2id from the master password and a random salt.
- Storage: Local file, no network access.
